## Installing
1. `npm (or yarn) install`
2. `npm run start:ipad` to launch a packaging server and open a debugger instance on _0.0.0.0:8081_
  - Alternatively run `npm run start` to just start the packing server
  - For Nuclide just run `Nuclide React Native: Start Debugging` in the command palette.
3. Edit the `src` folder only.

## Management
* The `master` branch is only to be used for working code. This branch should reflect a state which at any time could be used to demo a working version of the project.
* Use the develop branch for in-progress builds. Don't directly commit stuff in except when it's: a hotfix or a dependency modification (eg. upgrade) or config file edit.
* Use feature branches for merging new features and more extensive fixes into `develop`. Prefix feature branches with your initials (eg. `tm-homepage`)
  * Delete these once merged in, no dead branches pls üíÄ
* __Never merge in branches failing on CI.__
* Please sign-off commits (preferably with a GPG signature, otherwise with `git commit -S`)
* Preferably use Nuclide as an IDE for React Native. Xcode works too, but Nuclide has first-class support for launching a packaging service and debugging inside Atom.

## React
* Write a component with props on 1 line if:
	* ‚Ä¶the props are within 100 chars line-length
	* ‚Ä¶callbacks are lambdas/immediate returns
* For each new component put the component itself in `src/containers` or `src/components` and its style in `src/assets/styles/containers` or `src/assets/styles/components`, avoid inline styles.
* Only absolute imports
* Import style objects/StyleSheets as `s`:
`import s from 'src/assets/styles/components/Navigation'`
* When creating a style object or StyleSheet, put your related styles on 1 line (if eslint allows it) when having multiple styling rules:
```js
{
  // Order: flex, margin, padding, fonts, colors, rest‚Ä¶
  flexDirection: 'row', flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center',
  margin: 30,
  padding: 3,
  fontSize: 20, textAlign: 'center',
  backgroundColor: 'black', color: 'white',
}
```
* For text, spread on the provided globalStyle:
```
StyleSheet.create({
  ...globalStyle,
  color: 'pink',
});
```
Be sure to import it after positional styling and before all other styling so it overwrites the properties from globalStyle.
* Use ternary expressions for your conditions as much as possible
* Use lambda's as much as possible.

## Maintaining
* Use gitmoji for each commit. Install gitmoji-cli and create a git hook inside the root project (`gitmoji -i`).
* PR reviews are required to be marked OK by everyone before merging. Only use admin merge when discussed with everyone.
* Use issue & PR labels.
  * Multiple words should be chained with a dash (eg. `wont-fix`)
  * Use [GitScout](https://gitscout.com/) for issue tracking & project boards
* Clean up unused deps. Preferably keep using the currently integrated Greenkeeper.
* Tag release new master builds.

## Testing
* Run jest with coverage. `npm t` does this automatically.
	* Update your snapshots if needed with `npm run test:update`
	* Mock third party modules
  	* It's ok to skip a test if that means investing time to mock third party libs
* Use flow where suited. Don't check 3rd party stuff but focus on pure functions etc.
* When a PR fails due to a regression, check the Travis logs, find the issue and discuss it in the PR.
